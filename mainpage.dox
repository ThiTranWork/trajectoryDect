\mainpage Trajectory Outlier Detection

Introduction
===

This is a library for trajectory outlier detection that uses the algorithm presented by 
Jae-Gil Lee and others in their paper [Trajectory Outlier Detection: A Partition-and-Detect Framework][1] \[1\].


This code is based heavily on the source code made available on Jae-Gil Lee's [webpage][2]. The code on
on his website is a complete implementation of their algorithm, but like any good research prototype
includes little documentation. Additionally, it was written with Microsoft Visual Studio - 
it uses Windows-specific visualization and proprietary Microsoft C++ structures. 
Therefore, the goal of this project was to take that implementation and rewrite it to be a cross-platform library.
