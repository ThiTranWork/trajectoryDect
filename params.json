{"name":"Trajectory Outlier Detection","tagline":"An Open-Source Library","body":"Introduction\r\n===\r\n\r\nThis is a library for trajectory outlier detection that uses the algorithm presented by \r\nJae-Gil Lee and others in their paper [Trajectory Outlier Detection: A Partition-and-Detect Framework][1] \\[1\\].\r\n\r\n\r\nThis code is based heavily on the source code made available on Jae-Gil Lee's [webpage][2]. The code on\r\non his website is a complete implementation of their algorithm, but like any good research prototype\r\nincludes little documentation. Additionally, it was written with Microsoft Visual Studio - \r\nit uses Windows-specific visualization and proprietary Microsoft C++ structures. \r\nTherefore, the goal of this project was to take that implementation and rewrite it to be a cross-platform library.\r\n\r\n![Alt Image](example.png)\r\n\r\nSee API documentation [here](./html/index.html).\r\n\r\n[1]: http://dm.kaist.ac.kr/jaegil/papers/icde08.pdf \"Trajectory Outlier Detection Paper\"\r\n[2]: http://dm.kaist.ac.kr/jaegil/ \"Source Code\"\r\n<sub>\\[1\\] Jae-Gil Lee, Jiawei Han, and Xiaolei Li. 2008.
