This is a library for trajectory outlier detection based on code provided publicly by Jae-Gil Lee at http://dm.kaist.ac.kr/jaegil/.

The algorithm that this code executes is from a paper entitled "Trajectory Outlier Detection: A Partition-and-Detect framework", 
and can be found [here](http://dm.kaist.ac.kr/jaegil/papers/icde08.pdf)

Sample code using the library is provided in main.cpp and can be compiled with the command "make". A C++11 compatible compiler and gnuplot are required.

For more details see the [project page](hansenrl.github.io/trajectory/index.html).
